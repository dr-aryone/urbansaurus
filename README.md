# Urbansaurus

Urbansaurus is a chrome extension I'm building that adds a urban dictionary widget to google pages with a query of 

`define {word}`

If you haven't heard of [Urban Dictionary](http://www.urbandictionary.com/), it's a collection of definations created by users, that describe lots of modern word implications.
